## Outline
The main aim of this project was to utilise our existing knowledge of HTML, CSS/SCSS, React and Javascript to create a responsive e-commerce website. 

### Design

Below are 3 different designs/wireframes I created (using canva) for the project, ultimately I went with the Legion website design as it more closely resembled the MVP requirements of the project, I then adapted the design to better meet the MVP requirements further.

## MVP

The main requirements for this project were:

-   To have a Home Page
     -   Which contains:
        -   A Grid of products
        -   A Carousel of featured products
        
-   To have a Product Page (with id parameter). Similar to a product page on another site, allows the user to add to cart and select product variants.
        
-   To have all products stored in Firestore:
      -  Which stores the following information:
        -   quantity
        -   variants (could be colors, sizes, etc)
        -   price per unit
        -   name
        -   image url
        -   favourited or not (boolean)
-    To clarify, all data is to be stored in Firestore and fetched by the frontend, there is to be no static product data in the react application.

## Summary

I met the above requirements by first creating a website wireframe/design, then I worked on the MVP requirements. More specifically, for the MVP requirements, I made a basic layout of the frontend first, then built the backend, once that was done (i.e. populated with the required data) I then worked on completing each of the MVP requirements by building the relevant components for them. After all of this was completed, I then worked on media queries.
